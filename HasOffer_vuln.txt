HasOffers Improper Cookie Reusing (credential bypass)

Remote:	     Yes
Local:	     No
Vulnerable:  affiliatecashpile.com (probably others sites where the script is installed)
Impact:      4/5

Affiliatecashpile mobile is vulnerable to a credential bypass timing attack when a valid API Key is called from a browser
and then log into the login interface.
A malicious attacker when have found a valid API Key can use it to bypass the credential of this API Key user and change
everything on the account including payment request made into his bank account or paypal, dening the real users to get
their earnings.

The api key mobile interface when attacker reach a valid api key page, pass the login cookie into the browser.
The attacker only have to move to the login page and enter his own credential then the login interface will
redirect it into the phished account.


Workaround: The attacker need 2 things to be able to log into a valid user.
            1) A valid user acount for himself (with valid login / password)
            2) A valid phished or bruteforced API Key

            Only a browser is necessery to abuse of this hole, attacker go to the page with api key:
            http://publisher.affiliatecashpile.com/stats/stats.json?api_key=ENTERTHEAPIKEYHERE&start_date=2010-06-01&end_date=2011-07-02
            Replace the ENTERTHEAPIKEYHERE by the stolen API Key. Then go into affiliatecashpile.com and enter his valid credentials.
            Instead of getting logged with his own credentials he will have access to the account from the previous API Key viewed.
            The first cookie is ovewriting the second wich let the attacker use his own credentials.

Solution:   For the moment there's no solution. We recommend to disable the api key interface once it has been fixed.
